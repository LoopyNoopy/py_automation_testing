# Brief

This is my repo for me to test and learn different automation tools and frameworks.
Currently, in this repo there are examples of the following:

- PyTest, a Python testing framework that handles the running of automated tests
- Selenium - Standard for automating web tests that allows us to interact with the browser
- Appium - A framework used for automating Mobile Device Tests, including Browser on device tests - built off of Selenium
- Allure - An opensource report generation tool
- RabbitMQ - Used as a communication server so I have a dedicated machine to run tests (Idea for this was to simulate a build automation machine)
- Selenium Grid - A server / client framework that allows us to have multiple different environment to run our tests on, but accessible from 1 location
