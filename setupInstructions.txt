Install requirements.txt
Setup your IDE to use pytest
PyCharm -
    Click on python version in bottom right
    Interpreter settings
    On left click tools
    The click "Python Integrated Tools"
    Ensure either "AutoDetect(Pytest) or manually select pytest"
To run the code:
    PyCharm
    Go to the Terminal tab at the bottom and enter
    "py.test" - No quotation marks

I am unsure how to do this via visual Studio BUT
As long as you install the requirements.txt - you should be able to run the "py.test" command in the windows terminal (If opened in the folder)
