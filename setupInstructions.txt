Install requirements.txt
Setup your IDE to use pytest
PyCharm -
    Click on python version in bottom right
    Interpreter settings
    On left click tools
    The click "Python Integrated Tools"
    Ensure either "AutoDetect(Pytest) or manually select pytest"

For the "Codebase test" you will need to do either of the following:
Remove the "With open" loop and replace the URL User and Pass variables with your credentials
Create a text file with contains:
URL
User
Password
Due to this repo being public I have not included the text file in the repo - But you also need to point to the new text file in the "With Open" loop


To run the code:
    PyCharm
    Go to the Terminal tab at the bottom and enter
    "py.test" - No quotation marks

I am unsure how to do this via visual Studio BUT
As long as you install the requirements.txt - you should be able to run the "py.test" command in the windows terminal (If opened in the folder)
